# nanoscheme

Scheme meta circular evaluator / evaluator library.


Nanoscheme is tested on chicken scheme 5.
It may or may not work unmodified on other scheme implementations.

These modifications most of the time are trivial.

Nanoscheme is very basic and it does even support macros or syntatic expensions.
